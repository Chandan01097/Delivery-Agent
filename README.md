# 🛡️ AI-Powered Return Fraud Detection System

## 📌 Project Overview

E-commerce platforms face increasing losses due to **return fraud** — where customers return used, damaged, or even counterfeit products instead of the original item. This system leverages AI and automation to **verify returns**, reduce manual workload, and protect company revenue.

## 💡 Problem Statement

Customers sometimes abuse the return process by sending back altered or fake products. Since companies want to maintain a smooth customer experience, they often **issue full refunds without verification**, leading to:

* Major **financial losses**
* **Inventory mismatches**
* Reduced **customer trust**

Our system ensures every return is validated with image comparison — **before dispatch and after return** — using computer vision and deep learning.

## 🚀 Features

### 🔐 Secure Login

* Role-based login for employees
* OTP verification for secure access

### 📊 Employee Dashboard

* View pending orders, deliveries, and return requests
* Upload product images before and after delivery

### 📸 Image Capture

* **Pre-dispatch image**: Product photo is uploaded before shipment
* **Return image**: Returned product image is captured at the warehouse

### 🧠 AI Model: Return Verifier

* Uses deep learning to compare images
* Detects:

  * Damage (scratches, tears, stains)
  * Size, shape, tag, or color mismatches
  * Signs of tampering or counterfeit replacements
* Outputs a **match score** to indicate return authenticity

### 🧾 Automated Refund Decisions

* High match score → refund approved
* Low match score → refund rejected or flagged for review

## 🔄 Workflow

1. **Employee logs in** → OTP verified
2. **Pre-dispatch image** uploaded during packing
3. **Return image** uploaded during return handling
4. **AI compares both images**
5. **Refund decision** made automatically
